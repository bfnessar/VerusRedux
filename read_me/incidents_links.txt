INCIDENT TYPES:
	* Open (aka Active)
		https://dev20728.service-now.com/nav_to.do?url=incident.do?sys_id=46e3e949a9fe19810069b824ba2c761a
			* Called by Bow Ruggeri (an ITIL user), assigned to generic ITIL User
		* Accessible to any Admin
		* I THINK it's accessible to anyone with ITIL role (e.g. Beth Anglin can access this incident)
		* Only accessible to the End User who opened the incident
			* If an unauthorized user tries to access the incident, the screen will say "Record not found".

			* Called by Joe Employee; assigned to David Loo


	* Open Unassigned (aka Active)
		* Because ITIL users all have access to all incidents, this case should be no different from regular Open.

	* Resolved

			* Called by Joe Employee, assigned to Don Goodliffe
			* INC0000051
		* Can be commented on by ITIL users

	* Closed
		* Closed incidents cannot be commented on


USER ROLES:
	* End User
		* Can only view incidents that they opened themselves

	* ITIL User
		* Can view and comment on any incident I think

	* Admin
		* Same freedoms as ITIL user. Also, if I am impersonating a user and I leave a comment, the comment is attributed to that user.

THUS: Test cases should be as follows:
	* As ITIL:
		* Comment on any Open incident
		* "" 			Resolved incident
		* (don't bother with Closed incidents because they cannot be commented on)
	* As End User:
		* Comment on an Open incident (that he/she owns)
		* ""			Resolved		""
		* Same as above for Closed incidents
